Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field that involves the development of intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, perception, language understanding, and decision-making. AI aims to create systems that can mimic human intelligence to some extent, allowing machines to adapt, improve, and perform complex tasks without explicit programming.

### Interpretation of AI

AI can be categorized into different types based on its interaction with human intelligence:

- **Assisted Intelligence** - Involves machines aiding humans in completing tasks, such as sentence completion.
- **Augmented Intelligence** - Focuses on enhancing human capabilities through tools like predictive analytics based on data.
- **Autonomous Intelligence** - Refers to systems, like self-driving cars, that can operate independently.
